HR Attrition Analysis – Predicting Employee Turnover
📌 Introduction

Employee attrition (employees leaving an organization) is a critical challenge for businesses. High turnover increases recruitment costs and affects productivity.
This project analyzes HR employee data to predict attrition patterns, uncover key risk factors, and suggest actionable strategies for employee retention.

🎯 Objective

Identify employees most likely to quit.

Discover key factors influencing attrition (salary, job satisfaction, work-life balance, etc.).

Provide HR with data-driven recommendations to reduce turnover.

Visualize insights in Power BI dashboards for quick decision-making.

🗂️ Dataset

Synthetic dataset of 2,000 employees generated using Python.

Key features include:

Employee demographics (age, gender, education, department, role)

Job factors (salary, tenure, overtime, satisfaction, performance)

Target column: Attrition (Yes/No)

⚙️ Steps & Workflow
1️⃣ Data Preparation (Python)

Generated HR dataset using NumPy & Pandas

Cleaned & structured data (handled missing values, corrected types, treated outliers)

Performed feature engineering (income bins, tenure buckets, satisfaction levels, overtime categories)

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overall attrition rate ~ 50%

Higher attrition in Sales & Operations departments

Employees with low job satisfaction + high overtime most likely to quit

Low income + early tenure = higher attrition risk

3️⃣ Visualization (Python + Power BI)

Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn): Trend analysis & heatmaps

Power BI Dashboard: Interactive visuals for HR teams

📊 Power BI Dashboard Features

KPIs: Total Employees, Attrition Rate

Attrition by Department, Job Role, Gender, Age Group

Attrition vs. Income, Job Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, Performance

Interactive filters for deeper insights

🔑 Key Insights

Low job satisfaction + high overtime → Highest attrition risk

Sales & Operations → 25–30% higher attrition than average

Early-career, low-income employees → More likely to quit

💡 Business Recommendations

Improve Work-Life Balance → Reduce overtime & promote flexibility.

Department-Specific Retention Programs → Sales & Operations need focused support.

Salary Reviews for Junior Employees → Competitive pay reduces early-career exits.
